# ü§ù Github contributions

## Learning videos

At this point, the focus is not about Git and Github best practices. The learning videos here will cover the basic things needed to get started with contributing to any project using the Github UI. What you will learn will also help you to tackle the tasks that have been provided for you to do after watching the learning videos.

#### You will learn the following from the learning videos on this page:
- Forking a repo, and how to know which branch you are in.
- Contributions (overview, issues, commits) and branching.
- How to make pull request, and link an issue to pull request.
- Reviews (& branch, pull requests, linking issues continued).
- Managing files or folders (create, edit and delete).
- When to delete a branch connected to pull request or a fork.
- Syncing your fork.
- General information about the training tasks.

## Tasks

You will now learn to use everything you have learnt about in the learning videos. You should not have any issues while working on this task, if you follow the instructions to the latter. But incase you run into any issues, feel free to ask for help in the [Github discussion for part 1.](https://github.com/Ifycode/git-github-training/discussions/79) Or you can send the pull request anyway, and state the issue you have there in your pull request.

**Task 1**: Create an issue using the template provided in [issue 34](https://github.com/Ifycode/git-github-training/issues/34). Replace your @your-github-username-here with your own Github username when you create the issue.

**Task 2**: Follow the instructions in the issue you just created.
