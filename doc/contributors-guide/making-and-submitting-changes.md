# How to submit your changes to this training resource

Everyone is welcome to help improve the content of the Git and Github training resources. There are two repositories linked to the Git and Github project i.e. [learning resource repo](https://github.com/Ifycode/git-github-training-resource) and the [training repo](https://github.com/Ifycode/git-github-training). Interested contributors can follow the guides below when contributing to any of the Git and Github training repositories.

{% hint style="info" %}
 Interested contributors should note that taking the [Git and Github training](https://obiagba-mary.gitbook.io/git-and-github-training) can help you get better at contributing to the Git and Github training project (and any other Github projects they will be taking on in the future).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
As contributors you can indicate and share to the [Git and GitHub gitbook training resource](https://obiagba-mary.gitbook.io/git-and-github-training) on your portfolio, as long as you are among contributors listed in the [contributors section](https://github.com/Ifycode/git-github-training-resource#contributors-). Anyone who has contributed and has not been added to the contributors list should [notify repo admins through the learning resource repo's discussion.](https://github.com/Ifycode/git-github-training-resource/discussions/2)

### Learning resource repo: How to submit your changes

* Fork the [learning resource repo](https://github.com/Ifycode/git-github-training-resource) (Additional information: The default branch of the [learning resource repo](https://github.com/Ifycode/git-github-training-resource) has been set to develop branch. So on the "Create a new fork" page, you can leave the "Copy the develop branch only" checkbox as checked since you will need the develop branch for the next steps).
* Confirm that you are in the develop branch of your fork.
* Create a new branch from the develop branch and make your changes in the new branch you created.
* Send a pull request pointing to the develop branch of the original learning resource repo.
* Wait for review of your changes from the repo admin(s).

{% hint style="info" %}
The contributors interested in improving the contents of the learning resource can find the files to update in the [doc folder](https://github.com/Ifycode/git-github-training-resource/tree/develop/doc) of the [learning resource repo](https://github.com/Ifycode/git-github-training-resource).
{% endhint %}

### Training repo: How to submit your changes

* Fork the [training repo](https://github.com/Ifycode/git-github-training) (Additional information: The default branch of the [training repo](https://github.com/Ifycode/git-github-training) is the main branch. So on the "Create a new fork" page, make sure to uncheck the "Copy the main branch only" checkbox before clicking on the "create fork" button. This will allow you to also have the develop branch, since you will need the develop branch for the next steps).
* Go to the develop branch of your fork.
* Create a new branch from the develop branch and make your changes in the new branch you created.
